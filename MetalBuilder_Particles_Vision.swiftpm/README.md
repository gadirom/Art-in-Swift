This is a little app that you can open in Swift Playgrounds on an iPad/Mac.

The particles moving being aware of the human figure captured by the camera. When a particle attain a certain speed it produces sound and is colored in white. Also, the position of hands changes parameters of the simulation. 

This is an example of how you can use camera, Apple's Vision framework and atomic counters with my open source package [MetalBuilder](https://github.com/gadirom/MetalBuilder)

The sound is made by AVAudioEngine.

To run on iPad download the whole repository [Art-in-Swift](https://github.com/gadirom/Art-in-Swift) (Code->Download ZIP), run Files and unzip, then open this package (Density Simulator).
